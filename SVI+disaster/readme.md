# 🌲🔥 Street-View Imagery for Disaster Research  
### Wildfire, Hurricane & Multi-Hazard Damage Assessment

This repository contains curated resources and datasets related to **street-view imagery (SVI)** for disaster assessment, focusing on:

- 🔥 Wildfire damage analysis  
- 🌪 Hurricane damage assessment  
- 🌊 Flood and multi-hazard disaster scenarios  
- 🛰 Cross-view disaster intelligence (Satellite ↔ Street-View)

The goal is to support research in **hyperlocal disaster perception, damage recognition, and multimodal GeoAI systems**.

## 🔥 Wildfire & Street-Level Imagery

Street-level imagery provides fine-grained visual evidence of:

- Structural damage  
- Vegetation burn severity  
- Debris patterns  
- Infrastructure failure  

Unlike satellite imagery, street-view images capture **human-scale semantic details**, enabling high-resolution disaster interpretation.

## 🌪 Hurricane & Street-Level Imagery

For hurricane events, street-view imagery enables:

- Flood depth perception  
- Roof and façade damage detection  
- Debris field characterization  
- Infrastructure collapse assessment  

Street-view imagery is particularly valuable for:

- Bi-temporal comparison (pre- vs. post-disaster)  
- Damage severity classification  
- Change detection analysis  
- Multimodal fusion with satellite imagery
